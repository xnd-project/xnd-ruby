"""
A module for typing memory blocks using a close variant of the datashape type
language.

The underlying library -- libndtypes -- implements the type part of a compiler
frontend.  It can describe C types needed for array computing and additionally
includes symbolic types for dynamic type checking.

libndtypes has the concept of abstract and concrete types. Concrete types
contain the exact data layout and all sizes that are required to access
subtypes or individual elements in memory.

Abstract types are for type checking and include functions, symbolic dimensions
and type variables. Module support is planned at a later stage.

Concrete types with rich layout information make it possible to write
relatively small container libraries that can traverse memory without
type erasure.

The xnd module uses ndtypes to implement a general container for mapping most
Python types relevant for scientific computing directly to memory.
